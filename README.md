# NBA Web Scraper
A web scraper that scrapes a basketball website, cleans and transforms data using a mix of BeautifulSoup, regex and Pandas, and exports the scores and Boston Celtics players' stat lines for the day in .csv format. Sample exported files can be found in the test folder. You can use the script as is, or use pyinstaller to create an executable file.
