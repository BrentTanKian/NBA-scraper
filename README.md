# NBA Web Scraper
A web scraper that scrapes a basketball website, cleans and transforms data using a mix of BeautifulSoup, regex and Pandas, and exports the scores and Boston Celtics players' stat lines for the day in .csv format. Sample exported files can be found in the test folder. You can use the script as is, or use pyinstaller to create an executable file. Some of the functions are extremely long and clunkily written, and will be refactored in the future when time permits. Right now, the script serves its purpose, giving me the daily scores, and tells me how well or badly Boston Celtics players played in each game.
